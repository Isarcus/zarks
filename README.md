# zarks
A multifaceted library for my personal projects


## Please note:
I created this project as a way to learn Golang while keeping track of my work, and generating some cool art while I was at it.
However, because everything here was part of a lengthy learning process, it is **far** from polished, and I do not work on this project often.

I highly recommend looking at the far more advanced C++ rewrite of this project at [zarksCPP](https://github.com/Isarcus/zarksCPP).
